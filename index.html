                <p>Hi. I'm Joshua, but you probably already knew that if you're reading this.</p>
                <p>I first dabbled in building websites about 18 years ago, in the year 2000. That's pretty hard to believe even as I type it. My first experience was with <a href="http://www.angelfire.com">Angelfire</a> (which I just learned still exists). They advertise "no coding required" today, but back then they had an HTML cheatsheet. My first experience with code was copy and pasting <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags from that page. It wasn't long before 12-year-old me was drawn to the Geocities page builder as an alternative to coding.</p>
                <p>So, Geocities was where my first <em>real</em> websites were born in 2002.</p>
                <p>I am fortunate to remember a lot of my web design journey from that time. Even without a stable Internet connection, I spent most of my summer designing new layouts for my small <em>Legend of Zelda</em> fansite. The whole store is quite long, and not really the focus of this post, but it would be worth revisiting in the future.</p>
                <figure><img src="ttot-screenshot.jpg"><caption>This screenshot is one of my earliest hand-coded website designs. It was done entirely with absolute positioning. Content was published with a simple PHP "content management system" that loaded plain text files into the center content area. This screenshot was pulled from <a href="www.archive.org">Archive.org</a>.</caption></figure>
                <p>A combination of a rudimentary web design course in High School and the advice of a friend reintroduced me to coding in HTML, but now I could also use CSS and PHP.</p>
                <p>Overall, I was mostly self-taught, but I needed assistance making big leaps in coding. I didn't understand how to use HTML tables until taking the course in High School, I didn't understand absolute positioning or PHP without a couple private lessons, and I didn't understand CSS page layout until college.</p>
                <p>After college, my career mostly focused on graphic design (though working in the sign industry has a heavy emphasis on layout), and web design became more of a hobby. My only exposure was my continuing work in the online <em>Legend of Zelda</em> community.</p>
                <p>The web moves forward pretty quickly. I tried to stay relatively informed about major things that were happening, but I did not learn many new things for almost 10 years.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, it took me almost 10 years to realize that. So, in late 2017 I resolved to sit down and relearn. I pulled out <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/html5-for-web-designers">my old HTML5 book</a>, which was surprising still relavent 7 years after being published, and something just <em>clicked</em>. I felt very inspired to learn what I had missed. I started listening to web design lectures and podcasts during my commute. Some of them were about <a href="https://youtu.be/K9oY9Nwo1R8">progressive enhancement</a> and others were about <a href="https://youtu.be/TNhR6ol9mBc">really cool new layout tools in CSS</a>. And then I tried to learn Javascript for about a 12 time.</p>
                <p>I realized something important: my knowledge really wasn't out-of-date. Everything I already knew was still relavent, and people that I knew didn't know all of the new things either. <a href="http://thewebahead.net/104">A podcast really cemented this idea for me</a>: I don't need to learn everything about web design, and it's impossible to learn everything about web design.</p>
                <p>Since January, I have made web design a regular part of my routine and spent most of my efforts improving <a href="http://www.zeldauniverse.net">Zelda Universe</a>. I also started multiple small web design projects that I haven't published yet. I have a bad habit of starting personal web projects and never finishing them, but they are great learning experience either way.</p>
                <p>Recently, I bought a few new books and started listening to lectures and podcasts again. A couple days ago, without much thought, I turned on <a href="http://thewebahead.net/110">a podcast I knew I had already heard</a>. I did not remember what it was actually about, but I have come to respect both the host and her guest over the past several months (and even more so when I realized that he had written not only the reliable HTML5 book from 2010 but also <a href="https://domscripting.com/book/">a book about Javascript</a> that has been on my shelf for years as well) so I knew it would be a worthwhile exercise.</p>
                 <p>The podast is more than hour long and covers a range of topics, but at the end of the conversation are a few minutes of discussion about personal websites and how so many of them never make it online because we tell ourselves they just aren't quite good enough.</p>
                <p>This resonated with me. I have wanted to publish things for years and never gotten around to it. I want to write about web design and just play around with fun new CSS. I want to write about video games even when it doesn't fit the scope of what <em>Zelda Universe</em> covers. I want to write about events I attend, interesting articles I read, and just whatever else comes to mind.</p>
                <p>The conversation stuck with me. It's been rather hard to focus for the last couple of days. The sign industry is a busy place, but my head was spinning with ideas for a simple layout that would help me publish <em>now</em>. And this is it. The layout is certainly not polished. There are a lot of things I hope to improve over time, but today the most important part is just having a personal place to publish.</p>
                <p>This is the beginning of something new. Let's see where it goes.</p>
